# Django Oficial Tutorial

Throughout this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a basic poll application.

It’ll consist of two parts:

- A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
- An admin site that lets you add, change and delete polls.

This tutorial is written for Django 1.8 and Python 3.2 or later. If the Django version doesn’t match, you can refer to the tutorial for your version of Django by using the version switcher at the bottom right corner of this page, or update Django to the newest version. If you are still using Python 2.7, you will need to adjust the code samples slightly, as described in comments.
